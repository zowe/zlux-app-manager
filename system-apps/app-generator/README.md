# App Generator

This app can be installed for use in the Zowe Desktop in order to quickly create apps.
It will guide you through the choices for app creation and validate input, so that app creation is easy and correct.
The generator comes with "templates", which are boilerplate files that when combined with user input are used to create the first iteration of the new apps.
This App Generator is licensed Eclipse Public License 2.0, but the templates are unlicensed as they are intended to be utilized in your own project.
