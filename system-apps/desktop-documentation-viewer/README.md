# Zowe Desktop Documentation Viewer


- A new default web application enabling users to view text & pdf documents bundled into plugins. 

- To do: This viewer can be invoked via the Desktopâ€™s App2App communication scheme so that it can be popped up on-demand by the plugin, or opened directly by the user for them to be able to drill-down to each plugin & each documentation file.
