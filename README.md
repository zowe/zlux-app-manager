# zLUX

This is the project home of the zLUX portion of the Zowe Project. Within, there are several repositories and superprojects which help to categorize the components available for use.

#### This project is in active development and documentation may be brief at this time. Feel free to contribute to the Wiki and we'll keep the READMEs updated over time.

If you want to get started with a Zowe for the first time, it is best to start by cloning this "zlux" repository. Contained within is a flat collection of subrepositories which are a set of sample Apps for Zowe, the zLUX Framework, and an example zLUX server that pulls it all together.

New users should take a look at [zlux-example-server](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-example-server) to see how a simple zLUX server is assembled. You'll see the build scripts used to create the deploy/runtime folder structure needed, and a JS file that creates a custom implementation of the Zowe nodeJS-based server.

#### Note: When using zlux-example-server or any Zowe server which needs to make use of the Rocket ZSS (Z Secure Services) Server , please reach out to Rocket members of Zowe who can help to provide you with the external content required for these. In zlux-example-server in particular, you'll see references to "externals/Rocket" where Rocket content external to Github should be placed for full functionality.
